 *  @brief This file contains configurable variables for the Micro BLE Stack
 *  radio.
 *
 *  In general, the configuration values vary by device type, device version
 *  and board characteristics. The definitions and values listed in
 *  urfcfg.h and urfcfg.c can be changed or more sets of definitions and
 *  values can be added, depending on which version/type of device and what
 *  characteristics the board has.
 *
 *  @note User configurable variables except the elements of
 *  the power table are only used during the initialization
 *  of the MAC. Changing the values of these variables
 *  except power table elements after this will have no
 *  effect.

 * @note The use of these values completely depends on how the PCB is laid out.
 *
 * The device may come in more than one type of packages.
 * For each package, the user may change how the RF Front End (FE) is
 * configured. The possible FE settings are provided as a set of defines.
 * (The user can also set the FE bias, the settings of which are also provided
 * as defines.) The user can change the value of @ref RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS to
 * configure the RF FE as desired. However, while setting the FE configuration
 * determines how the device is configured at the package, it is the PCB the
 * device is mounted on (the EM) that determines how those signals are routed.
 * So while the FE is configurable, how signals are used is fixed by the EM.
 * As can be seen, the value of @ref RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS is organized by the EM
 * board as defined by EMs produced by Texas Instruments Inc. How the device
 * is mounted, routed, and configured for a user product would of course be
 * user defined, and the value of @ref RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS would have to be set
 * accordingly; the user could even dispense with the conditional board
 * compiles entirely. So too with the usage of the Tx Power tables.
